          <p>Bon Voyage is game inspired to the Board Game Uppsala. Starting from a given city, players will be given a city to place in relationship to other cities in play, whether they are
          north, west, east or west to them. At the end of the game your score will be how many mistakes you made, so strive to make the lowest score possible!
          In the future the hotseat multiplayer version will come, with a bluffing component of the game!</p>
